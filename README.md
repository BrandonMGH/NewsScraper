**Assignment Details:**

In this assignment, we had to develop an app that allowed us to scrape information from a website using the Cheerio NPM to gather the information and then display that information on a webpage for users to look at that information.  In this particular instance, the Cheerio NPM would gather article information from a news website calld Quillette.  The article information would inclue the title of the article, the author of the article, a snippet of the article and a link to the full article.  This information would be displayed on a website called Quillette Forum and would allow visitors to the website to comment on various articles and then delete those articles, as well as scrape for new articles or clear out the articles currently on their page.
